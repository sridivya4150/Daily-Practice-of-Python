#python loops-while,for,for each
#while-it execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true
i=1
while i>5:
    print(i)
    i+=1
#if we dont increment i or else the loop will continue forever
#break statement-by using break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true
